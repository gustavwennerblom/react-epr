# react-epr

## Getting started

* Clone the repository
* Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
* Run `yarn start` - this will fire up a development server and serve the content on localhost:8080

## Deploying
* Never tested, but should be possible to simply do `yarn build` and then pick up the `.js` file in the `dist` folder and drop it in on any web page.
